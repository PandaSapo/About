# Intro to me
Hello! My name is David Carballeira and I'm a student at the University of Puerto Rico
Recinto de Rio Piedras. I'm a Computer Science major in the Natural Sciences faculty. 
My goal with computer science is to learn all kinds of programming, networking and
communication skills that will help me in my professional career. In this page you
will find multiple projects that I have worked on whether it was alone or with help
of other students.
